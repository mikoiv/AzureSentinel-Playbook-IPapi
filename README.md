# AzureSentinel-Playbook-IPapi

This playbook utilizes the free IP-API.com interface with a Sentinel Playbook (Logic App). IP-API.com has a very good quality Geolocation database that can be queried without any authentication for free, for non-commercial usage. 

Before using the solution, make sure you read the [IP-API Terms of Service and Usage Limits](https://ip-api.com/docs/legal), and switch to the very reasonably priced Pro membership if needed.
